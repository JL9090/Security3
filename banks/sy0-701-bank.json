      "Question": "Which of the following BEST summarizes why organizations adopt a “shared responsibility model” in cloud security?",
      "A": "The provider secures everything and the customer does nothing",
      "B": "Security responsibilities are split between provider and customer depending on service model",
      "C": "Customers must secure the cloud hardware",
      "D": "Providers manage all identities for customers automatically",
      "CorrectAnswer": "B",
      "RationaleCorrect": "In cloud, responsibility depends on whether you use SaaS, PaaS, or IaaS. Providers secure underlying infrastructure; customers secure things like identity, data, configuration, and application logic to varying degrees. Understanding this prevents dangerous gaps (“I thought the provider handled that”).",
      "RationaleA": "False and leads to major security gaps.",
      "RationaleB": "",
      "RationaleC": "Customers typically do not secure physical hardware in public cloud.",
      "RationaleD": "Identity is often customer-managed (or jointly integrated), not fully provider-managed by default."
